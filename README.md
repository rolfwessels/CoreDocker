This project contains some scafolding code that I use whenever I start a new project. It followes some best practices.

## Features
 * RESTful web API.
 * GraphQL (+ authorization + permissions)
 * Reactjs Dashboad UI integrated
 * Authorization (OpenId with integrated identity server).
 * Swagger for API documentation.
 * MongoDB document storage database.
 * CI Appvayor && Travis for build automation
 * Docker files to compile and compose a server
 * Developed using TDD practices.
 

## Todo
 * Code coverage in build process.
 * Code analytics - look at resharper cli tools.
 * Better API with integrated website.
 * Decide what to do about logging, still not sold on the injection method (and log4net not using appsettings.json).
 * Signal-r replacement.
 * 3rd party authentication - github or google would be awesome (Tired of always writing own user management system).
 * Apply some CQRS patterns.
